vector and list

av[1] -> must be positive int

merge-insert sort (Ford-Johnson algorithm)
->divide-conquer
->recursively
-> It works by recursively dividing the input array into smaller subarrays 
and sorting those subarrays then merging them back together to obtain the sorted array.
->divide the array into two halves, sort each half, and then merge the sorted halves back together.
This process is repeated until the entire array is sorted.

DIVIDE: Divide the list or array recursively into two halves until it can no more be divided.

CONQUER: Each subarray is sorted individually using the merge sort algorithm.

MERGE: The sorted subarrays are merged back together in sorted order. 
The process continues until all elements from both subarrays have been merged.
